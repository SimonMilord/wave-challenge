## Implementation

I am particularly proud of the the way I wrote my code. I tried to refactor and clean the code base as much as possible for 2 purposes: Scalability and Readability.

The code is written such that it would be easy to expand further on it and add additional features from the React to the Scss. It is also very easy to understand what is going on as I tried to write code in a way that my code would speak for itself. This is a huge advantage when working on projects of big scale with other developers as it saves a lot of time understanding the code base. More practically, I leveraged the use of components, props and comments to achieve better code quality.

Given the scale of the project, I didn't go crazy on the components amount, but I believe that the project was built so that it would be easy to repurpose or re-use some components or portions of the code. Finally, it was not mandated for the project, but I made sure that the SCSS would also be flexible using notably mixins and the BEM naming convention.
